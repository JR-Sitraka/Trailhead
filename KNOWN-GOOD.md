# Known-Good State & Project Hard Rules — Trailhead

Referenced from `AGENTS.md`: required context on every implementation
task. Two sections, both append-only in spirit — entries get
corrected, not silently deleted.

## Known-good state

- [2026-07-21] PostgreSQL 17 installed via
  `winget install --id PostgreSQL.PostgreSQL.17 --exact` on Windows —
  silent/unattended mode sets NO superuser password by default. Must
  be set manually post-install: temporarily set
  `host all all 127.0.0.1/32` and `host all all ::1/128` to `trust` in
  `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\data\pg_hba.conf`, restart the
  `postgresql-x64-17` service, connect with no password,
  `ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD '...'`, then revert both lines to
  `scram-sha-256` and restart again.
- [2026-07-21] When editing that file via `notepad` from PowerShell,
  must use `Start-Process notepad <path> -Wait` — bare
  `notepad <path>` does not block the shell, so a `Restart-Service`
  issued right after reads the OLD file, not the edit. Caused a real
  failed connection loop this session before being caught.
- [2026-07-21] Local PostgreSQL 17 service name:
  `postgresql-x64-17` (confirm via `Get-Service -Name "*postgres*"` if
  this differs on a future machine/install).
- [2026-07-21] Local databases created: `trailhead_dev`,
  `trailhead_test`.
- [2026-07-21] adm-zip: `entry.header.attr` holds the ZIP external
  file-attributes field; compression method `99` means AES encryption
  (`AES_ENCRYPT`), NOT a symlink marker — do not reuse that check
  pattern for anything else in this codebase.
- [2026-07-21] adm-zip's `addFile()` normalizes/strips path-traversal
  segments in entry names and always sets file type `S_IFREG` — it
  cannot natively construct raw traversal or symlink test fixtures.
  Override `entry.entryName` / `entry.attr` directly after `addFile()`
  to produce real test bytes (see `tests/preprocessing.test.ts` and
  `tests/repositories.route.test.ts` for the working pattern).

## Project hard rules

(none yet — entries above are environment facts, not incident-derived
hard rules; nothing has risen to that bar yet)
